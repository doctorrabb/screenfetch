    changelog
**** **** **** ****

v1.7.9
 - Added support to DETECT the following window managers: dwm, awesome, and WindowMaker
 - Added support for lighter backgrounds. If you have a lighter background, specify -l as a flag on the command-line. This will turn all white output to dark gray output.
 - screenFetch was featured in the ALM (Arch Linux Magazine)! The issue can be found
   and downloaded at http://www.archlinux.org/static/magazine/2010/ALM-2010-Apr.pdf

v1.7.7
 - Added FVWM support per request of goran'agar on the Arch forums.

v1.7.6.5
 - Fixed broken -s flag to take screenshot.
 - Put calling for verbose function back into other functions.

v1.7.6 (important)
 - Working distribution detection! Most of the distributions I've included have been untested as of yet. Which means I could REALLY use some testers 
for these distros. The ones that still need testing are as follows: SUSE, Mandriva/Mandrake, Gentoo, Fedora, Red Hat Linux, and BSD. If you would like 
to help test these distributions, let me know by emailing me at kittykatt@archlinux.us
 - Reworked a lot of the code to be functions instead of repeating parts. Looks a lot cleaner now.
 - This update was mainly Kingdomcome's doing. So thank him profusely.

v1.7.5 (HUGE)
 - Massive rewrite, cleaning up a huge portion of the code.
 - Made several repeating parts of the code into functions.
 - Learned getopts. Rewrote flag support with it. Flags now supported are as follows:
    ~ -D 'DISTRO NAME'   Specify distribution name
    ~ -c 'command'    Specify custom screenshot command.
    ~ -V    Print current version of script.
    ~ -v    Turn on verbose output.
    ~ -s    Take screenshot.
    ~ -n    Display info only and no ASCII logo.
    ~ -h    Display help menu.
 - Added version number to DE reporting. Except LXDE. Because they fail.
 - Thanks to h2 for many, many, many suggestions and a lot of help. This update would most likely not have been possible without him.
