**##** *#* TO DO LIST *#* **##**

This small list will be the central place where I will list ideas and 
things I want to happen with screenFetch.

 - WMs still needing support:
   - Compiz
   - Awesome
   - dwm
   - fvwm
   - Enlightenment
   - wmaker

 - I want the user to be able to specify on CLI when executing the 
script the distro logo they want to be produced. I've already added the 
flags in --help. They are -d|--distro=. But I can't figure out how to 
pick up the user input from either "-d <DISTRO>" or 
"--distro='<distro>'". Any help would on reading that input would be 
greatly appreciated.

 - I want to do the same as above again, only this time it's with 
-c|--command=, which will be a way for the user to specify a custom 
screenshot command on executing the script in CLI. Exact same problem: 
not sure how to pick up the input.

 - I'd also like to have working, universal shell type detection. Would 
be awesome.

 - Working distribution detection. Sounds impossible, right? I want it. 
I mean look at inxi, right?

That's about it for now. If you can help with any of these, please 
please PLEASE let me know by emailing me at kittykatt@archlinux.us or by 
stopping by SilverIRC on your favorite IRC client. The network can be

Thank you for any help.
