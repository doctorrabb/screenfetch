screenFetch - A system/theme information fetcher for Linux screenshots.

This handy Bash script can be used to generate one of those nifty 
terminal theme information + ASCII distribution logos you see in 
everyone's screenshots nowadays. You choose the distribution logo, and 
can customize the colors and commands that the script uses to take the 
actual screenshot.

This script is very easy to add to and can easily be extended. If you 
have any ideas/additions to make, please do so at 
http://github.com/KittyKatt/screenFetch or by emailing me at 
kittykatt@archlinux.us . You can also reach me by connecting to my IRC 
network, SilverIRC, at irc://kittykatt.silverirc.com:6669/randomz . Any 
ASCII logo additions would be welcome, as well.

All you need to do is download the file "screenFetch" and edit the 
settings at the top of the file. There are comments that should make all 
of the settings fairly easy to edit there.

Have fun and happy screenshotting. ;)
